# PortfolioTrakr

A project built using Python, Flask, HTML, Jinja2, Bootstrap, MySQL, RegEx, Bcrypt, OOP and Finnhub Stock API.


This project includes a .env file that stores a variable called API_KEY; this API key is for the Finnhub Stock API. If you wish to download/clone this repository and run the program on your own localhost, you can get a free API Key from finnhub.io (upon registering for an account). Please save the .env file in the main project folder (the same folder that contains server.py).

AWS deployment coming soon!
