        <p>Thank you for visiting PortfolioTrakr!</p>
        <p>My name is Charan Karthik and I'm the creator of PortfolioTrakr. Prior to developing this site, I was using
            Google Sheets to keep track of my investment portfolio. I was happy with how the sheets turned out and the
            functionalities I was able to implement, but I wanted something better. And thus PortfolioTrakr was born! I
            began building PortfolioTrakr with the intentions of creating something cleaner, more fluid, and more robust
            than what I had already made with Google Sheets. <br/> I also wanted to create something that could be easily shared and would allow others to have an easy, un-intimidating way to track their investments. Before I knew it, the hours turned into days and all of that work I put in resulted in a product that achieved all the goals I had envisioned and more. I'm very proud of the final product and I personally use it at least once a week to check in on my investment portfolio.</p>

        <p>Although PortfolioTrakr is meant to be a simple and easy to use web app, it's still an active, growing
            project. Next time you visit, you might find another feature or two. I am frequently working to improve the
            features, look and feel, and services that PortfolioTrakr is able to provide. If you have any feature
            requests or want to contribute to the PortfolioTrakr project, please reach out to me on <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charankarthik">LinkedIn</a>. If you're interested in seeing the code
            behind PortfolioTrakr please visit my <a href="https://github.com/Charan-Karthik">Github page</a>. Once
            again, thank you for visiting PortfolioTrakr!</p>
