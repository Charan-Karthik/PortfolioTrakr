        <p>Thank you for visiting PortfolioTrakr!</p>
        <p>My name is Charan Karthik and I'm the creator of PortfolioTrakr. Prior to developing this site, I was using Google Sheets to keep track of my investment portfolio (see below for what PortfolioTrakr used to look like vs what it looks like now!). I was very happy with how the sheets turned out and the functionalities I was able to implement, but I wanted something better. And thus PortfolioTrakr was born! I began building PortfolioTrakr with the intentions of creating something cleaner, more fluid, and more robust than what I had already made with Google Sheets. Before I knew it, the hours turned into days and all of that work I put in resulted in a product that acheived all the goals I had envisioned and more. I'm very proud of the final product and I use it at least once a week to check in on my investment portfolio.</p>
        
        <p>Although PortfolioTrakr is meant to be a simple and easy to use web app, it's still an active, growing project. Next time you visit, you might find another feature or two. I am frequently working to improve the features, look and feel, and services that PortfolioTrakr is able to provide. If you have any feature requests or want to contribute to the PortfolioTrakr project, please reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charankarthik">LinkedIn</a>. If you're interested in seeing the code behind PortfolioTrakr please visit my <a href="https://github.com/Charan-Karthik">Github page</a>. Once again, thank you for visiting PortfolioTrakr!</p>
